# This script is responsible for cloning new repos and keeping existing repos up
# to date. It can be run as often as you want (and will detect when it's
# already running, so as not to spawn parallel processes), but once or twice per
# day should be more than sufficient. Each time it runs, it updates the repo
# and checks for any parents of HEAD that aren't already accounted for in the
# repos. It also rebuilds analysis data, checks any changed affiliations and
# aliases, and caches data for display.
